    \class MediaItem
    \brief The MediaItem class is a container for all the media item related data needed for sharing.

    \ingroup transfer-engine-lib

    MediaItem is used internally by Nemo Transfer Engine, but MediaItem object instance is
    passed to each share plugin via MediaTransferInterface and it is meant to be a read-only object.

    MediaItem can be accessed via MediaTransferInterface::mediaItem() method. MediaItem stores internal
    data as key-value pairs. Data can be accessed via value() method using pre-defined ValueKey keys.

    Note: Depending on the use case (sharing, download, sync) MediaItem may not contain data for all
    the keys. For example when MediaItem is created for the sync event, it doesn't contain Url or
    MimeType values or if plugin doesn't require account, then AccountId won't be defined for this
    MediaItem.

    Depending on the share UI which plugins provides, the content of the MediaItem varies. Bluetooth or
    NFC sharing doesn't need account or descriptio, but then again Facebook sharing needs that information.

    \sa value() MediaTransferInterface::MediaItem()

/*!
