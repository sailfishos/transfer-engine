    \class MediaTransferInterface
    \brief The MediaTransferInterface class is responsible of implementing

    \ingroup transfer-engine-lib

    MediaTransferInterface is an abstract class which must be implemented by
    each share plugin. The subclass of this class is resposible of providing:

    \list
        \li Status information of the sharing
        \li Progress of the sharing
        \li Information, if cancel and restart actions are supported
        \li Starting and/or canceling the sharing
    \endlist


    The flow:
    The instance of this class is created when SailfishShare::start() method is
    called.
*/

/*!
    \enum MediaTransferInterface::TransferStatus

    Transfers status

    \value NotStarted            Transfer not started
    \value TransferStarted       Transfer is ongoing
    \value TransferCanceled      Transfer is canceled usually via user actions
    \value TransferFinished      Transfer is finished successfully
    \value TransferInterrupted   Transfer failed
*/

/*!
    \fn virtual QString MediaTransferInterface::displayName() const = 0

    Subclass must implement this method. Return a human readable display
    name for the service e.g. "Facebook".
 */

    \fn virtual QUrl MediaTransferInterface::serviceIcon() const = 0

    Subclass must implement this method. Return the URL to the service
    icon. Service icon can be e.g. Facebook or BT icon.

 */


/*!
    \fn virtual bool MediaTransferInterface::cancelEnabled() const = 0

    Subclass must implement this method. Return true if cancel is supported
    or false otherwise.

    Subclass must implement this method. Return true if restart is supported
    or false otherwise.
 */

    \fn virtual void MediaTransferInterface::start() = 0

    Subclass must implement this to start the actual sharing operation. This
    same method is called when sharing is restarted.
 */

/*!
    \fn virtual void MediaTransferInterface::cancel() = 0

    Subclass must implement this to cancel the ongoing share operation.
*/


/*!
    \fn void MediaTransferInterface::statusChanged(MediaTransferInterface::TransferStatus status)

    This signal with changed \a status is emitted when setStatus() is called.

    Note that this signal is NOT meant to be emitted by the subclass. Instead of
    emitting it manually the subclass should use setStatus() method, which causes
    this signal to be emitted automatically.
*/

/*!
    \fn void MediaTransferInterface::progressUpdated(qreal progress)

    This signal is emitted when the \a progress changes. Progress is changed when the
    subclass calls setProgress() method.

    Note that, like the statusChanged() signal, also this signal is not to meant to be
    emitted by the subclass. It's emitted automatically when subclass calls setProgress().

    BT share UI won't provide information related to the accounts because "accountId" or "description"
    are not required for the Bluetooh. But then again Facebook share UI provides this information.
    This means that because plugin provides the Share UI, it knows which fields are set for the
    MediaItem instance.
